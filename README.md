# Instaclone
Basically a clone of Instagram, this is for purposes of User creation and Video / Image Upload logic practice. Camera logic works great I even uploaded a few pictures to firebase straight from my phone! Now I am working on the Instagram "stories" like ability to click a users picture and see recent photos they have uploaded.
